Motivation
This project was started as a motivation for learning Machine Learning Algorithms and to learn the different data preprocessing techniques and finally to build a machine learning model.

In this Iris dataset, there are three kind of species i.e., Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica and 50 samples on each species. In this project we will classify the Iris species based on their features such as Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length and Petal width.
