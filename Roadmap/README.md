# Let's get started

## Tools:

### If you prefer local installation

* [Python](https://www.python.org/). Python 3 is the best option.
* [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Anaconda is popular in Data Science and Machine Learning communities.It comes with packages installed ( like * numpy
  * pandas
  * scikit-learn
  * matplotlib).
  
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) provides "free" GPUs ( no need to install anything, try directly from your browser).

## Let's go!

**[Learn how to use Jupyter Notebook](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-data-intro/core/notebook.html) (5-10 minutes).** (You can [learn by screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb7FT68tcA8) instead.)

brief exercise: **[An introduction to machine learning with scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html)**. Do it in `ipython` or a Jupyter Notebook, coding along and executing the code in a notebook.
