# Hello Machine Learning Entheasists!!ðŸ‘‹

Machine learning is the ability of machine to learn without being explicitly programmed. We have the inputs and the outputs, and we look for the realtion between them. We got 3 types:
* Supervised Learning:  where we have labeled data( known)
* Unsupervised Learning: where we have unlabeled data.
* Reinforcement learning:the agent( the model)learn in envirenmnet the best startegy to perfoem an action based on rewards and punishements system!

What you need to know:
* Statistics( like calculus and linear algebra).
* Python skills ( you can choose another language, but it's recommanded you start with python).
* Machine learning algorithms.

# Let's get started

# Pyton- Skill Up!
* [W3achool-python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)
Ps: it's recommanded that you go through all the path including libraries use like panda and numpy. 
* [Datacamp-Datascience with python](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python)


## Tools:

### If you prefer local installation

* [Python](https://www.python.org/). Python 3 is the best option.
* [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Anaconda is popular in Data Science and Machine Learning communities.It comes with packages installed ( like 
  * numpy
  * pandas
  * scikit-learn
  * matplotlib).
  
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) provides "free" GPUs ( no need to install anything, try directly from your browser).

For datasets, use kaggle:
*[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

## Let's go!

**[Learn how to use Jupyter Notebook](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-data-intro/core/notebook.html) (5-10 minutes).** (You can [learn by screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb7FT68tcA8) instead.)

brief exercise: **[An introduction to machine learning with scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html)**. Do it in `ipython` or a Jupyter Notebook, coding along and executing the code in a notebook.
